Project Portfolio Reflection
Project One: Analysis of Run-time and Memory for Data Structures
Problem Statement:
In Project One, the primary objective was to analyze the run-time and memory efficiency of various data structures. The problem involved selecting appropriate data structures for specific scenarios, considering factors like time complexity and space complexity.
Approach:
In order to tackle the issue at hand, I carried out a thorough examination of various data structures including arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues. I devised algorithms to accomplish typical tasks such as insertion, deletion, and search. Using benchmarking and profiling techniques, I analyzed their performance attributes and made informed choices regarding which data structure to employ in particular scenarios.
Importance of Data Structures:
Having a good understanding of data structures is a fundamental aspect of designing efficient algorithms and building scalable software. It is important to choose the right data structure for a program as this can have a significant impact on its performance. Therefore, having a solid grasp of these concepts is crucial for writing optimized and effective code.
Roadblock Resolution:
Throughout the project, I faced difficulties in optimizing certain operations related to data structures. To overcome these obstacles, I adopted a collaborative approach. I consulted online resources, discussed with my peers, and reviewed relevant course materials. This not only helped me gain insights into alternative solutions but also enabled me to refine my implementations for better efficiency.
Project Two: Sorting and Printing Courses in Alphanumeric Order
Problem Statement:
Project Two involved creating a program to sort and print a list of Computer Science program courses in alphanumeric order.
Approach:
I organized the list of courses alphabetically using efficient sorting algorithms and an array data structure, then printed the sorted result.
Software Design Evolution:
During my work on these projects, I improved my approach to software design. I became more proficient at selecting appropriate data structures based on the specific requirements of the problem, and at prioritizing modularity and code organization. These experiences also reinforced the importance of algorithmic efficiency and taught me the significance of balancing time and space complexity.
Program Maintainability and Readability:
The projects I have worked on have had a significant impact on how I write code. Nowadays, I give importance to writing code that is easy to maintain, read, and adapt. For this, I structure my code in a logical way, add meaningful comments, and use descriptive names for variables and functions. This approach helps in better collaboration within the team and makes it easier for future modifications of the codebase.
